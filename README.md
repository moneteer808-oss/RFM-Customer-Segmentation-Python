# RFM Customer Segmentation - Python

Python implementation of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) customer segmentation analysis with interactive visualizations and HTML reporting.

## Project Focus
- **Python/Jupyter Notebook** implementation for data analysis
- **Interactive visualizations** with Plotly
- **HTML reports** generation in the `reports/` folder
- **Customer segmentation** using RFM methodology
